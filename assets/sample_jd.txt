Full job description
We are seeking a business-savvy Generative AI Developer to join our AI innovation team. You’ll contribute to the development of generative AI solutions using large language models across structured and unstructured data sources, with a strong focus on business alignment, rapid prototyping, and full-scale production deployments.

This role bridges deep technical expertise with business fluency. You’ll collaborate with both engineering teams and business stakeholders to design, build, document and scale generative AI systems across a range of cloud environments.


Key Responsibilities
- Design and implement retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) architectures using LLMs over large unstructured datasets.
- Apply advanced embedding techniques and vector search methods to enable high-precision semantic retrieval.
- Collaborate directly with business teams to identify use cases, gather requirements, and convert ideas into AI prototypes and production systems.
- Build rapid prototypes using tools such as Streamlit, Jupyter Notebooks and then evolving them into scalable full stack systems following business acceptance.
- Use Python, LangChain, LangGraph, pydantic, pydanticAI or LlamaIndex to orchestrate workflows and agent-based LLM reasoning.
- Deploy solutions across cloud-agnostic environments, supporting customer preference for Azure, AWS, GCP, or on-prem infrastructure.
- Communicate effectively with both technical and non-technical stakeholders, translating AI potential into business value.


Must-Have Qualifications
- Programming: Advanced proficiency in Python, with production experience using agent and orchestration frameworks such as LangChain, LangGraph, pydantic, FastAPI, pydanticAI, LlamaIndex, etc.
- LLM Integration: Deep understanding of embedding models, structured and unstructured multi-modal data processing, and CAG/RAG methodologies.
- Prototyping & Deployment: Experience developing POCs with tools such as Streamlit and then transitioning them to full stack production systems.
- Business Acumen: Strong ability to assess business processes and propose AI-driven optimizations.
- Communication: Excellent verbal and written communication skills in English; ability to clearly articulate technical solutions to executive and business audiences.
- Cloud Platforms: Experience deploying AI solutions on Azure, AWS, or GCP; working knowledge of services like vector databases, LLM APIs, scalable app hosting, and NoSQL storage (e.g., Azure AI Search, Cosmos DB, OpenAI Service, Bedrock, or Vertex AI).


Preferred Qualifications
- Advanced AI Skills: Familiarity with agentic AI frameworks, structured query generation, LLM fine-tuning, LLM content filters, safety and evaluation.
- Development: Experience with full-stack development and web frameworks such as Angular, React, etc.
- Certifications: Cloud certifications (Azure, AWS, GCP).
- Mathematical Strength: Strong background in mathematics or applied statistics for machine learning and data science scenarios.


Preference will be given to candidates who:
- Hold a degree in Computer Science, Engineering, or a related field from a recognized post-secondary institution.
- Can demonstrate exceptional achievement, such as widely adopted open-source contributions and high-impact GitHub/GitLab projects.


- Job Types: Full-time, Part-time, Freelance
- Pay: ₹67,994.00 - ₹85,896.00 per year
- Expected hours: 40 per week
- Schedule: Monday to Friday
